	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Sposato: Founder of Phatbits and Picnik&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I founded Phatbits, which made XML desktop applications, in 2004. A year later, Google offered to acquire the business. We closed the deal after quick and collegial negotiations, and our group integrated into the Google Gadgets division easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one regret was agreeing to stay on for four years. I wound up leaving after a year. I underestimated what it would feel like to be a salaryman, no longer in control of my own destiny. But overall, the integration was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sold Picnik, a photo-sharing site, to Google five years later, I assumed everything would be about the same. That wasn't the case. This time, negotiations were complex, lasting almost six months.We faced a dizzying amount of changes in the first three months after the acquisition, being shuttled from one part of the company to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-third of our 25-person team, including my two business partners, quit right off the bat. I stayed for two years to offer some sense of continuity. By 2012, Google shut down Picnik entirely. I felt like I let a bunch of great people down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I should have insisted that Google's crystal ball for Picnik was clearer. I sometimes wonder whether I should have sold the company at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as an angel investor in six startups, I advise entrepreneurs who are thinking about selling to think carefully about the return on investment, including the effect on team culture, not just the bottom line.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/bodycopy&gt;

Running a poll or doing informal research can easily lead to false positives &amp;#x2014; thus wasted time and effort. So we decided to build a simple service, called Backer, that any developer can use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Backer crowdfunding page corresponds to a single feature or service, created by the people who are responsible for building it. It's up to that team to decide what feature to hypothetically build and what financial commitment they'd like to see in order to build it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;full-width-title note-style dark ta-center&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Backer in Action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;note-style muted ta-center&quot;&gt;The first Backer project by App.net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;full-width-title note-style dark ta-center&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Backer Features&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=&quot;body-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;You don't have to integrate App.net APIs to use Backer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can choose to accept payment via credit cards, Bitcoin, or both.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We handle the entire process on a turn-key basis. If the project is successful, App.net sends the money to the project owner. If the project is not successful, the project owner has no further obligation or work to do.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Successful open source Backer projects are not charged a fee. Successful proprietary Backer projects will be charged a 5% fee. Unsuccessful Backer campaigns incur no fees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Backer passes through any credit card processing fees incurred. Bitcoin transactions are processed free of charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In other words, &lt;i&gt;successful open source Backer projects will receive 100% of committed Bitcoin funds&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We'll keep you in good company. Projects will be vetted to ensure your Backer project runs alongside other high-quality, legitimate projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;App.net staff will help out developers launching a new Backer by offering tips about best practices, setting up the project description, as well as help with marketing and awareness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id=&quot;story&quot; class=&quot;story theme-main&quot;&gt;

    

    
    

    

            
    &lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;IF you think that protests about overzealous law enforcement are over the top, listen to what unfolded when the police suspected that David Eckert, 54, was hiding drugs in his rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;Eckert is a shy junk dealer struggling to get by in Hidalgo County, N.M. He lives a working-class life, drives a 16-year-old pickup and was convicted in 2008 of methamphetamine possession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;Police officers, suspecting he might still be involved in drugs, &lt;a title=&quot;Details in pdf of lawsuit&quot; href=&quot;http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/files/eckert.pdf&quot;&gt;asked him to step out of his pickup early last year&lt;/a&gt; after stopping him for a supposed traffic violation. No drugs or weapons were found on Eckert or in his truck, but a police dog showed interest in the vehicle and an officer wrote that Eckert&amp;#x2019;s posture was &amp;#x201C;erect and he kept his legs together.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;That led the police to speculate that he might be hiding drugs internally, so they took him in handcuffs to a nearby hospital emergency room and asked the doctor, Adam Ash, to conduct a forcible search of his rectum. Dr. Ash refused, saying it would be unethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;&amp;#x201C;I was pretty sure it was the wrong thing to do,&amp;#x201D; Dr. Ash told me. &amp;#x201C;It was not medically indicated.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;Eckert, protesting all the while, says he asked to make a phone call but was told that he had no right to do so because he hadn&amp;#x2019;t actually been arrested. The police then drove Eckert 50 miles to the emergency room of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grmc.org/&quot;&gt;the Gila Regional Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;, where doctors took X-rays of Eckert&amp;#x2019;s abdomen and performed a rectal examination. No drugs were found, so doctors performed a second rectal exam, again unavailing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;Doctors then gave Eckert an enema and forced him to have a bowel movement in the presence of a nurse and policeman, according to a lawsuit that Eckert filed. When no narcotics were found, a second enema was administered. Then a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;The police left the privacy curtain open, so that Eckert&amp;#x2019;s searches were public, the lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;After hours of fruitless searches, police and doctors arranged another X-ray and finally anesthetized Eckert and performed a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;&amp;#x201C;Nothing was found inside of Mr. Eckert,&amp;#x201D; the police report notes. So after he woke up, he was released &amp;#x2014; after 13 hours, two rectal exams, three enemas, two X-rays and a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;The hospital ended up billing Eckert $6,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;When I came across this case, it seemed far-fetched to me &amp;#x2014; more like rape than law enforcement. But the authorities, hospital and doctors all refused to comment, and, a few days ago, the city and county settled the lawsuit by paying Eckert $1.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;This wasn&amp;#x2019;t a unique case. A few months earlier, &lt;a title=&quot;A pdf&quot; href=&quot;http://www.thedailybeast.com/content/dam/dailybeast/2013/11/13/timothy_young_complaint.pdf&quot;&gt;a man named Timothy Young who lives nearby says that police officers pulled him over&lt;/a&gt;, forcibly strip-searched him in a parking lot and then took him to a hospital for a forced X-ray and rectal examination while he was handcuffed. Nothing was found, so he was released &amp;#x2014; only to receive a hospital bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;And a few weeks before Eckert&amp;#x2019;s ordeal, &lt;a title=&quot;Another pdf&quot; href=&quot;http://www.aclu-nm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Complaint-Jane-Doe-v-Various-Defendants-12-18-13.pdf&quot;&gt;a 54-year-old American woman crossing from Mexico into El Paso was strip-searched&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the University Medical Center of El Paso. She says in a lawsuit that, over six hours, she was shackled to an examination table and subjected to rectal and vaginal examinations &amp;#x2014; with the door open to compound her humiliation. After a final X-ray and CT scan, all of which turned up nothing, she was released &amp;#x2014; and billed for the procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civilrightslawnewmexico.com/&quot;&gt;Joseph P. Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;, Eckert&amp;#x2019;s lawyer, notes that such abuses are not random but are disproportionately directed at those on the bottom rungs of society. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s a socioeconomic issue,&amp;#x201D; he said. &amp;#x201C;It&amp;#x2019;s the indignities forced on people who are not articulate, not educated and don&amp;#x2019;t have access to legal services.&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;Police are caught in a difficult balancing act, and obviously the abuse of Eckert isn&amp;#x2019;t representative. But it is emblematic of something much larger in America, a kind of inequality that isn&amp;#x2019;t economic and that we don&amp;#x2019;t much talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x2019;s the kind of inequality that lies behind police stops for &amp;#x201C;driving while black,&amp;#x201D; or unequal implementation of stop-and-frisk policies, or &amp;#x201C;zero tolerance&amp;#x201D; school discipline codes that lead many low-income children to be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;This inequality has a racial element to it, but it is also about social class (Eckert is white but struggling financially). This is about Americans living in different worlds. If you&amp;#x2019;re a middle-class reader, you probably see the justice system as protective. If you&amp;#x2019;re a young man of color, you may see it as threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;story-body-text story-content&quot;&gt;So as we discuss inequality in America, let&amp;#x2019;s remember that the divide is measured in more than dollars. It&amp;#x2019;s also about something as fundamental as our dignity, our humanity and our access to justice; it&amp;#x2019;s about the right of working stiffs not to endure forced colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class=&quot;b-singlepost-body&quot;&gt; In the last days I received multiple requests to translate my posts for foreign readers, as they have very limited information about the happenings in Ukraine. This material describes events which took place in Kyev on January 22 and 23. &lt;br&gt;Sharing and distribution is appreciated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;22 January 2014. Battles on streets of Kiev.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/00s.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came to Kiev. I came to see for myself what is happening here. Of course, an hour after arriving at Maidan, you begin to understand that everything what you've read in dozens of articles, saw in TV news reports is total crap. In the upcoming reports I will try to, as objectively as possible, to sort out this new wave of Kiev revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually reporters try to answer the question: &amp;#x201C;Who came out to Maidan and why.&amp;#x201D; Depending on the political leaning of MSM, the answers are different. Some say it's &amp;#x201C;fascists who came out to lynch the Moscali (Ukranian derogatory for Moscovites and Russians in general).&amp;#x201D;, some say &amp;#x201C;they're bums and slackers, who've got nothing better to do&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;instigators on the government payroll.&amp;#x201D; In reality, there is no answer. Those who came out are completely different. Remember, how a couple of years in Moscow there was a MSM buzzword &amp;#x201C;angry townspeople.&amp;#x201D; Here you see football fans, retirees, office plankton. And everyone is standing together. A sweet, ol' grandmother is pouring Molotv cocktail in a nationalists' bottles; and a manager of a large company is carrying ammunition to the student. And as it seems to me at this time, these people do not have a specific plan, nor idea of what to do next. Of course, individually, everyone has their own plan to &amp;#x201C;save Ukraine.&amp;#x201D; For some its &amp;#x201C;we need a couple of crates of AKs and grenades, we'll sort things out here quickly.&amp;#x201D; Others &amp;#x201C;need to ask the world community for help and bring in the UN troops.&amp;#x201D; At this time there is no central idea of what to do, an idea that can unite and point in one direction the people at Maidan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that is completely clear &amp;#x2013; people came out against Yanukovich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burning barricades are visited by people who have come to let out anger and resentment that have accumulated over the years &amp;#x2013; for the excesses of cops; for the corruption; for the 'golden toilet'; for the stupidity of the sell-out officials. An elderly man, 80 years of age, walks up to young guys in masks and asks them for a bottle of flaming liquid. They ask him:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;- Grandad, you wont be able to throw it far enough!&lt;br&gt;- Just give me one, I want to show these beasts that they cannot treat me like this&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Ukranians had bad luck with opposition. The street mob is not controlled by anyone. Klichko and his company met with Yanukovch yesterday. Later they came out to the people, began to say something, but no one believes them. And no one wants to follow them. The main mass of people are completely non-political. They come out to kick Yanukovich and his company's ass. Everyone has their own grievances and vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are very real battles on the streets of Kiev right now. Unfortunately, Yanukovich is far, so the Berkut (Ukranian SWAT) and soldiers have to play the role of Yanukovich' ass. The scenery in Kiev is scary. Black smoke, burning barricades and constant explosions. Berkut's flashbangs and the protestors' fireworks explode in the streets. Each side is shooting at the other and there are already first casualties(2 to 5 based on different sources).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's go to the barricades?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;cutid1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I rented a room in the hotel &quot;Dnepr&quot;, the very center on the European square. I come up to the main entrance, all doors are locked, lights are out. A group of men in helmets and protection, hanging nearby, greet me &amp;#x201C;Welcome to Kiev, Mister.&amp;#x201D; - they've confused me with a foreign tourist. Everyone's laughing. It turns out that the entrance to the hotel is through a local bar. The security guy opens the door and leads me through dark hallways to the lobby. The lights are off, so as not to attract attention. After all, the hotel is almost at the front line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. European square. Back when it was all starting, there was a stage here, from which politicians pontificated their smart ideas about the future of Ukraine. Now the politicians have move on to Maidan, and the European square has become the rear base of the revolution. Cars with food arrive here; old tires for the bonfires, wood, medicine and reinforcements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/01.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Mihaila Grushevskogo street. The first barricade has been erected here. The guards do not allow in outsiders. Only the press, the volunteers, and the activists, ready to fight Berkut, are allowed to pass. All onlookers are stopped at the approach, to prevent them from interfering with work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/02.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. This is main burning barricade near the Dinamo stadium, about 100 meters away from the first. It consists of hundreds of burning tires, which are brought here from all parts of the city. The demonstrators got lucky with the wind &amp;#x2013; it carries the black smoke directly at the squads of Berkut and national guard standing behind the fires. The smoke completely obscures the view and both sides are currently working blind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/03.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. A bunch of onlookers watch the fight. The battle continues for 4 days in a row.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/04.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/05.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Activists run up, bearing shields and toss stones. Nobody sees the enemy, but everyone knows how far Berkut can toss grenades. No one approaches the determined line without a shield. The grenades that land are flashbangs and tear gas. This does not have much effect on the seasoned protestor. The key is to avoid a direct hit or a nearby explosion, which can cause concussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/06.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. The fire is constantly fed by more tires. The smoke screen must be dense! At one point Berkut attempt to feel out the protestors from a hill using a powerful projector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/07.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/08.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. There are special men on the field of battle, who watch the troop movements of the opponent. The man in the mask and shield will always tell you where it's safe: &amp;#x201C;Stop! There's a devil shooting from behind the column, don&amp;#x2019;t go father that line! We're about to smoke him out of there!&amp;#x201D;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/09.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. The scouts constantly refresh information about the enemy position and coordinate activists, who toss stones and Molotov cocktails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/10.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. The authorities turned several water cannons at the demonstrators. Surprisingly no one is afraid of the water. This scout is climbing a balcony to see what's behind the smoke screen. The drenched people dry at the campfires. And some just walk around wet. There's an incredible atmosphere here: on one hand you can feel the weariness of the frustrated people, on the other hand euphoria and expectation of victory. In such light, no one is paying attention to wet clothes. Only medic volunteers ask people to go warm up to avoid frostbite.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/11.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. Activists with Molotov cocktails at the front line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/12.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/13.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;14. Actually the center of Kiev is very pretty right now&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/14.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15. Protestors periodically shoot fireworks at Berkut. The entire square lights up and people cheer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/15.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;16. Somewhere over the the Berkut troops are getting ready for another assault. The assault is always sudden and everyone fear its. This morning Berkut has already shown that if the need be they can scatter everyone in 5 minutes. Why they do not &amp;#x2013; is a different question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;17. Catapult 1, seized and destroyed, is replaced by Catapult &amp;#x2013; 2. In reality it's just a large slingshot, but to keep continuity the call it Catapult &amp;#x2013; 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/17.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;18. Miracle of the engineering thought! Catapult -2 quickly went through testing and was admitted into the armament of the rebels. The crew consists of six people: three people pull the elastic; two people hold the frame; one person loads and delivers ammunition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/18.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19. The wonder machine works well, but slow. The missiles fly far into the night, but reloading takes 2-3 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/19.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20. In a nearby alley people prepare Molotov cocktails. In reality, most of the bottles contain either pure kerosine or gasoline, the recipe is no longer followed &amp;#x2013; no time. Empty glass bottles are in a big deficit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/20.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21. I'm looking at the guys and everyone is drinking Pepsi. I'm wondering: why drink this crap, it's freezing outside? As it turns out, bottles ran out and someone brought several crates of soda. So as not to waste, everyone's drinking together. Even infant food jars are used. All glass containers fly at the cops. The filling of the containers at the front line is done by the activists of the 'right sector,' but in the rear the bottles are filled by regular grandmas and pretty young women. Those who the guards do not allow passage to the front.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/21.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22. There are problems with bottles here. The mixture inside is liquid, not thick like in the original Molotov recipe, and the fuse is a simple rag. During the throw part of the gasoline can spill out and light up the thrower. Of course the fire is quickly put out, but the effect is very low. Almost 50% of all cocktails spill out before hitting their target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/22.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/23.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24. The onlookers on the hill help out in any way they can. Sometimes they use lasers to blind the Berkut fighters. At one point the police was able to climb the colonnade entrance of the stadium and began to rain Molotovs and gas grenades down on the protestors. The onlookers use lasers to hit a Berkut in the eye, or try to find snipers on the roofs. There are constant rumors of snipers, although no confirmation of their existence has been produced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/24.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;25. Volunteer giving out dry, waterproof boots at the front line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/25.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;26. A young woman with a tea kettle approaches an activist on the front line to keep them hydrated. Some carry sandwiches, some dry clothing. Later I will describe in detail how things work here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/26.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;27. Campfire behind the barricades, where the wet and the frozen dry and warm up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/27.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;28.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/28.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;29. On my way back I see a group of people, trying to open a manhole. I ask them why are they trying to open the manhole? &amp;#x201C;We want to turn off the water so that Berkut will stop hitting us with water.!&amp;#x201D; The manhole does not open, this is a government district and all manhole covers are sealed securely from inside. Later they tried to break the manhole cover with sledge. I tried to explain that this is pointless, but I was ignored. The were not able to break through and they're still getting hit with water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan1/29.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;23 January 2014. Temporary cease fire at Maidan.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;30. &lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/00s.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to dispel the most common myths about Maidan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.&quot;They destroyed the whole city&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not true. All of the action you see in the pictures are happening on a small square near the entrance to a Dinamo stadium. This is a government sector, there is no intereference in peaceful life outside of this area. If you make an analogy with Moscow, imagine that the barricades are someone in the area of Ilinka or Varvarka, near the president's administration. Sure, it's the center, but regular Moscovites wouldn't notice. There is dark smoke and fire on all pictures: those are mostly burning tires. There is not tangible damage to the buildings. Unfortunately one store burned down last night near the barricades, resulted from a poorly thrown molotov cocktail. Even the statue of Lobanovsky, located in the epicenter of fighting has been covered with cloth to prevent damage. Overall, the protesters are very careful regarding property. They've take apart fences and benches, but no windows are broken, noone is vandalizing, and all looters are caught and beaten. So the picture is pretty apocalyptic, but things are not so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &quot;This is not a revolution, nothing horrible is happeneing&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also not true. This is a real revolution. Decide for yourselves: it's been two months since the center of Kiev has been in the hands of the opposition. Several government buildings are seized. The work of many government offices is paralyzed. The opposition has created barricades, which the authorities have not be able to take. Despite the freezing temps, tens of thousands of people are on the streets for the last two months. The system of defense and supply chain are established. There is perfect order at the protestor HQ, people are fed, dressed, people are pooling money to gather supplies. The most important thing: the people in power are unable to restore order. The police has failed several times at try to storm the barricades. I'll make a separate post about this, but trust me, the only way to dismantle this is with heavy artillery, or drop in commandos. Every day the opposition is securing more territories. What is this if not a revolution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &quot;The entire Kiev is paralyzed, there is no peaceful life for the regular people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kiev is living its own life. All stores and cafes are working, people are going to work, study in universities, get married, divorce and even die their own death. Most of the Kiev populace are not inconvenienced. Imagine if Navalny took over the Red Square and set up his camp there. What would change for you, Moscovites? Nothing. So the only people who are inconvenienced are toruists. A few stores and cafes had to close down in the very center. Also, those living in the center have troubles with logistics. But the entire Kiev is not paralyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, when you know all the truth, let&amp;#x2019;s see how this day was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;31. From the morning everything remains in fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/01.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;32. The protestors use metal shields to defend themselves from water the police are pouring them with. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/02.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;33. Road signs can serve as good shields.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/03.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;34. The Maidan&amp;#x2019;s missile forces. Lots of pyrotechnics are being brought up to the camp, all these rockets fly towards Berkut&amp;#x2019;s positions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/04.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;35. Hearths always require more tires to be thrown into. Because of ash and ice, ground level already rose by one meter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/05.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;36.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/06.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;	&lt;br&gt;37. Where necessary, the police gets stoned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/07.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;38. Everything is tightened with a smokescreen. Burning tires turned out to be a very efficient tactics. Police troops can&amp;#x2019;t see what is happening and are unable to attack, though there are disadvantages as neither the protesters can see the police&amp;#x2019;s positions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/08.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;39. This night was burned children&amp;#x2019;s clothing store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/09.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;40. A catapult is always working on the front line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://rendering.ru/media/varlamov/maidan2/10.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;41. Not many people show up on the Maidan in the morning &amp;#x2013; the majority arrives at night, after work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/11.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;42.	&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/12.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;43. At midday Klichko came to the barricades and announced the temporary truce. Second round of negotiations with Yanukovich was due to take place today, and Klichko asked to cease fire and extinguish tire blazes until 8 PM. The police promised not to open fire on protesters, to stop throwing grenades and pouring water. Everyone agreed &amp;#x2013; Klichko happened to be the only opposition leader whom the crowd listens to. Well done! Just yesterday nobody was listening to him. After the truce came into effect, firemen started extinguishing the burning barricade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/13.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;44. A wonderful view opened once the fire went out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/14.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;45. People immediately started advancing to the forefront which was previously engulfed by fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/15.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;46. Berkut&amp;#x2019;s positions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;47. Berkut troops were standing angry and soaked in smoke. Throughout the truce I spotted no provocations from either side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/17.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;48. Protestors are making photos in front of Berkut, Berkut in front of the protestors &amp;#x2013; war is war, but everyone needs to updates pics in social networks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/18.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;49.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/19.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;50. Scores of soldiers and Berkut are standing in small groups up to the horizon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/20.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;51.	&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/21.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;52. Monument to Lobanovsky next to the stadium is neatly covered with cloth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/22.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;53. People get warm next to campfire. Is revolution possible without a bicycle? I say no!&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/23.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;54. People on the hill are prepared for an assault. Stones, incendiary bottles and tires tightened with barbwire will be thrown to the attackers in case of necessity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/24.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;55. &amp;#x201C;Katyusha rocket launchers&amp;#x201D; used for shooting fireworks to the police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/25.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;56. Preparation of Molotov&amp;#x2019;s cocktails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/26.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;57. Bottles and stones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/27.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;58. Cocktails are being prepared by women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/28.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;59. You&amp;#x2019;ve probably heard about people banging metal with sticks. Many asked why &amp;#x2013; this is sort of a signal. When nothing happens, nobody is taping. When casual stone- and grenade-throwing takes place, the knock is monotonous, in order to set rhythm and keep the morale. When Berkut attacks, drumming becomes louder and everyone hears that &amp;#x2013; for some it is a signal to run away, for some, on the opposite &amp;#x2013; defend the barricades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/29.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;60. Man glues his store&amp;#x2019;s showcase, even though not a single his window was broken in four days. This store sells expensive furniture, and the ad urges not to rob it. As I said, there are no marauders in Kyiv &amp;#x2013; everything is perfectly organized, contrary to Bishkek, where, as I remember, the city was plundered in half a day. Nothing like that takes place here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/30.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;61. People hammer the snow, then load it to sacks and bring to the barricades. Snow serves as the main building material here. Sacks are being poured by water and snow turns into ice &amp;#x2013; monolithic barricades which come out are very difficult to destroy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/31.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;62. The Maidan&amp;#x2019;s quarries. People break the sett into easy to throw stones, load into sacks and bring to the frontline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/32.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;63. That&amp;#x2019;s how it looks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/33.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;64. They carry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/34.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;65. A stove.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/35.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;66. Modern art.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/36.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;67. Someone started a rumor about the Armenian Diaspora willing to pay for any information about the murder of their compatriot on Maidan. Later it turned out to be fake. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/37.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;68. One of the protesters. Russian press usually describes the participants of Maidan as &amp;#x201C;extremists, radical thugs, ultras, members of nationalistic groups, motley nationalist, sometimes openly Nazist public, extremist militants, rioters, pogromists, rebels&amp;#x201D; etc&amp;#x2026;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/38.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;69. A journalist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/39.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;70. According to NTV (russian pro-government tv-channel), this is an &amp;#x201C;amuck radical&amp;#x201D;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/40.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;71. Look at the people. I said it already, but will repeat: all social classes are present on the squares &amp;#x2013; from students to pensioners.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/41.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;72. Grannies for Timoshenko.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/42.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;73. Another extremist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/43.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;74. Women with food and tea always walk among the protesters &amp;#x2013; sometimes it looks like you&amp;#x2019;re on a banquet, not on a revolution. To find someone hungry is an uneasy job: the man on photo complaints that he put on three kilograms in a month :). Food is being brought every day, usually it is supplied by sympathizing Kyevites and businessmen who can&amp;#x2019;t go to the barricades but support the revolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan2/44.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are a foreign journalist, feel free to reprint on your website or in your newspaper with reference or indication of authorship, and please let me know by sending the link to e-mail:&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:kdguseva@gmail.com&quot;&gt;kdguseva@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/article&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class=&quot;rdb-page-break&quot; /&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;article class=&quot;b-singlepost-body&quot;&gt; In the last days I received multiple requests to translate my posts for foreign readers, as they have very limited information about the happenings in Ukraine. This material describes events which took place in Kyev on January 22 and 23. &lt;br&gt;Sharing and distribution is appreciated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;22 January 2014. Battles on streets of Kiev.&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://varlamov.me/2014/maidan1/00s.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came to Kiev. I came to see for myself what is happening here. Of course, an hour after arriving at Maidan, you begin to understand that everything what you've read in dozens of articles, saw in TV news reports is total crap. In the upcoming reports I will try to, as objectively as possible, to sort out this new wave of Kiev revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually reporters try to answer the question: &amp;#x201C;Who came out to Maidan and why.&amp;#x201D; Depending on the political leaning of MSM, the answers are different. Some say it's &amp;#x201C;fascists who came out to lynch the Moscali (Ukranian derogatory for Moscovites and Russians in general).&amp;#x201D;, some say &amp;#x201C;they're bums and slackers, who've got nothing better to do&amp;#x201D; and &amp;#x201C;instigators on the government payroll.&amp;#x201D; In reality, there is no answer. Those who came out are completely different. Remember, how a couple of years in Moscow there was a MSM buzzword &amp;#x201C;angry townspeople.&amp;#x201D; Here you see football fans, retirees, office plankton. And everyone is standing together. A sweet, ol' grandmother is pouring Molotv cocktail in a nationalists' bottles; and a manager of a large company is carrying ammunition to the student. And as it seems to me at this time, these people do not have a specific plan, nor idea of what to do next. Of course, individually, everyone has their own plan to &amp;#x201C;save Ukraine.&amp;#x201D; For some its &amp;#x201C;we need a couple of crates of AKs and grenades, we'll sort things out here quickly.&amp;#x201D; Others &amp;#x201C;need to ask the world community for help and bring in the UN troops.&amp;#x201D; At this time there is no central idea of what to do, an idea that can unite and point in one direction the people at Maidan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only thing that is completely clear &amp;#x2013; people came out against Yanukovich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burning barricades are visited by people who have come to let out anger and resentment that have accumulated over the years &amp;#x2013; for the excesses of cops; for the corruption; for the 'golden toilet'; for the stupidity of the sell-out officials. An elderly man, 80 years of age, walks up to young guys in masks and asks them for a bottle of flaming liquid. They ask him:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201C;- Grandad, you wont be able to throw it far enough!&lt;br&gt;- Just give me one, I want to show these beasts that they cannot treat me like this&amp;#x201D;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Ukranians had bad luck with opposition. The street mob is not controlled by anyone. Klichko and his company met with Yanukovch yesterday. Later they came out to the people, began to say something, but no one believes them. And no one wants to follow them. The main mass of people are completely non-political. They come out to kick Yanukovich and his company's ass. Everyone has their own grievances and vision of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are very real battles on the streets of Kiev right now. Unfortunately, Yanukovich is far, so the Berkut (Ukranian SWAT) and soldiers have to play the role of Yanukovich' ass. The scenery in Kiev is scary. Black smoke, burning barricades and constant explosions. Berkut's flashbangs and the protestors' fireworks explode in the streets. Each side is shooting at the other and there are already first casualties(2 to 5 based on different sources).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's go to the barricades?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b class=&quot;ljcut-link lj-widget&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ljcut-brace&quot;&gt;(&amp;#xA0;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ljcut-decor&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zyalt.livejournal.com/984735.html#cutid1&quot; class=&quot;ljcut-link-expand&quot;&gt;read more...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zyalt.livejournal.com/984735.html#cutid1&quot; class=&quot;ljcut-link-collapse&quot;&gt;Collapse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ljcut-brace&quot;&gt;&amp;#xA0;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;post-body entry-content&quot;&gt;
People occasionally ask why LLVM-compiled code sometimes generates SIGTRAP signals when the optimizer is turned on. After digging in, they find that Clang generated a &quot;ud2&quot; instruction (assuming X86 code) - the same as is generated by __builtin_trap(). There are several issues at work here, all centering around undefined behavior in C code and how LLVM handles it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This blog post (the first in a series of three) tries to explain some of these issues so that you can better understand the tradeoffs and complexities involved, and perhaps learn a few more of the dark sides of C. It turns out that C is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a &quot;high level assembler&quot; like many experienced C programmers (particularly folks with a low-level focus) like to think, and that C++ and Objective-C have directly inherited plenty of issues from it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Translation available in: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog-ja.intransient.info/2011/05/c-13.html&quot;&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Both LLVM IR and the C programming language have the concept of &quot;undefined behavior&quot;.  Undefined behavior is a broad topic with a lot of nuances. The best introduction I've found to it is a post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.regehr.org/archives/213&quot;&gt;John Regehr's Blog&lt;/a&gt;.  The short version of this excellent article is that many seemingly reasonable things in C actually have undefined behavior, and this is a common source of bugs in programs. Beyond that, any undefined behavior in C gives license to the implementation (the compiler and runtime) to produce code that formats your hard drive, does completely unexpected things, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/N/nasal-demons.html&quot;&gt;or worse&lt;/a&gt;.  Again, I would highly recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.regehr.org/archives/213&quot;&gt;John's article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Undefined behavior exists in C-based languages because the designers of C wanted it to be an extremely efficient low-level programming language.  In contrast, languages like Java (and many other 'safe' languages) have eschewed undefined behavior because they want safe and reproducible behavior across implementations, and willing to sacrifice performance to get it.  While neither is &quot;the right goal to aim for,&quot; if you're a C programmer you really should understand what undefined behavior is.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before getting into the details, it is worth briefly mentioning what it takes for a compiler to get good performance out a broad range of C apps, because &lt;b&gt;there is no magic bullet&lt;/b&gt;.  At a very high level, compilers produce high performance apps by a) doing a good job at bread and butter algorithms like register allocation, scheduling, etc. b) knowing lots and lots of &quot;tricks&quot; (e.g. peephole optimizations, loop transformations, etc), and applying them whenever profitable. c) being good at eliminating unnecessary abstractions (e.g. redundancy due to macros in C, inlining functions, eliminating temporary objects in C++, etc) and d) not screwing anything up.   While any of the optimizations below may sound trivial, it turns out that saving just one cycle out of a critical loop can make some codec run 10% faster or take 10% less power.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before getting into the dark side of undefined behavior and LLVM's policy and behavior when used as a C compiler, I thought it would be helpful to consider a few specific cases of undefined behavior, and talk about how each enables better performance than a safe language like Java.  You can look at this either as &quot;optimizations enabled&quot; by the class of undefined behavior or as the &quot;overhead avoided&quot; that would be required to make each case defined.  While the compiler optimizer could eliminate some of these overheads some of the time, to do so in general (for every case) would require solving the halting problem and many other &quot;interesting challenges&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is also worth pointing out that both Clang and GCC nail down a few behaviors that the C standard leaves undefined.  The things I'll describe are both undefined according to the standard and treated as undefined behavior by both of these compilers in their default modes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Use of an uninitialized variable:&lt;/b&gt; This is commonly known as source of problems in C programs and there are many tools to catch these: from compiler warnings to static and dynamic analyzers.  This improves performance by not requiring that all variables be zero initialized when they come into scope (as Java does).  For most scalar variables, this would cause little overhead, but stack arrays and malloc'd memory would incur a memset of the storage, which could be quite costly, particularly since the storage is usually completely overwritten.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b id=&quot;signed_overflow&quot;&gt;Signed integer overflow:&lt;/b&gt;  If arithmetic on an 'int' type (for example) overflows, the result is undefined.  One example is that &quot;INT_MAX+1&quot; is not guaranteed to be INT_MIN.  This behavior enables certain classes of optimizations that are important for some code.  For example, knowing that INT_MAX+1 is undefined allows optimizing &quot;X+1 &amp;gt; X&quot; to &quot;true&quot;.  Knowing the multiplication &quot;cannot&quot; overflow (because doing so would be undefined) allows optimizing &quot;X*2/2&quot; to &quot;X&quot;.  While these may seem trivial, these sorts of things are commonly exposed by inlining and macro expansion.  A more important optimization that this allows is for &quot;&amp;lt;=&quot; loops like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;for (i = 0; i &amp;lt;= N; ++i) { ... }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this loop, the compiler can assume that the loop will iterate exactly N+1 times if &quot;i&quot; is undefined on overflow, which allows a broad range of loop optimizations to kick in.  On the other hand, if the variable is defined to wrap around on overflow, then the compiler must assume that the loop is possibly infinite (which happens if N is INT_MAX) - which then disables these important loop optimizations.  This particularly affects 64-bit platforms since so much code uses &quot;int&quot; as induction variables.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is worth noting that unsigned overflow is guaranteed to be defined as 2's complement (wrapping) overflow, so you can always use them.  The cost to making signed integer overflow defined is that these sorts of optimizations are simply lost (for example, a common symptom is a ton of sign extensions inside of loops on 64-bit targets).  Both Clang and GCC accept the &quot;-fwrapv&quot; flag which forces the compiler to treat signed integer overflow as defined (other than divide of INT_MIN by -1).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Oversized Shift Amounts:&lt;/b&gt; Shifting a uint32_t by 32 or more bits is undefined.  My guess is that this originated because the underlying shift operations on various CPUs do different things with this: for example, X86 truncates 32-bit shift amount to 5 bits (so a shift by 32-bits is the same as a shift by 0-bits), but PowerPC truncates 32-bit shift amounts to 6 bits (so a shift by 32 produces zero).  Because of these hardware differences, the behavior is completely undefined by C (thus shifting by 32-bits on PowerPC could format your hard drive, it is &lt;b&gt;*not*&lt;/b&gt; guaranteed to produce zero).  The cost of eliminating this undefined behavior is that the compiler would have to emit an extra operation (like an 'and') for variable shifts, which would make them twice as expensive on common CPUs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dereferences of Wild Pointers and Out of Bounds Array Accesses:&lt;/b&gt; Dereferencing random pointers (like NULL, pointers to free'd memory, etc) and the special case of accessing an array out of bounds is a common bug in C applications which hopefully needs no explanation.  To eliminate this source of undefined behavior, array accesses would have to each be range checked, and the ABI would have to be changed to make sure that range information follows around any pointers that could be subject to pointer arithmetic.  This would have an extremely high cost for many numerical and other applications, as well as breaking binary compatibility with every existing C library.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dereferencing a NULL Pointer:&lt;/b&gt; contrary to popular belief, dereferencing a null pointer in C is undefined.  It is &lt;i&gt;not defined to trap&lt;/i&gt;, and if you mmap a page at 0, it is &lt;i&gt;not defined to access that page&lt;/i&gt;.  This falls out of the rules that forbid dereferencing wild pointers and the use of NULL as a sentinel.  NULL pointer dereferences being undefined enables a broad range of optimizations: in contrast, Java makes it invalid for the compiler to move a side-effecting operation across any object pointer dereference that cannot be proven by the optimizer to be non-null. This significantly punishes scheduling and other optimizations.  In C-based languages, NULL being undefined enables a large number of simple scalar optimizations that are exposed as a result of macro expansion and inlining.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you're using an LLVM-based compiler, you can dereference a &quot;volatile&quot; null pointer to get a crash if that's what you're looking for, since volatile loads and stores are generally not touched by the optimizer.  There is currently no flag that enables random NULL pointer loads to be treated as valid accesses or to make random loads know that their pointer is &quot;allowed to be null&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Violating Type Rules:&lt;/b&gt; It is undefined behavior to cast an int* to a float* and dereference it (accessing the &quot;int&quot; as if it were a &quot;float&quot;). C requires that these sorts of type conversions happen through memcpy: using pointer casts is not correct and undefined behavior results.  The rules for this are quite nuanced and I don't want to go into the details here (there is an exception for char*, vectors have special properties, unions change things, etc).  This behavior enables an analysis known as &quot;Type-Based Alias Analysis&quot; (TBAA) which is used by a broad range of memory access optimizations in the compiler, and can significantly improve performance of the generated code.  For example, this rule allows clang to optimize this function:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;float *P;
 void zero_array() {
   int i;
   for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000; ++i)
     P[i] = 0.0f;
 }
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
into &quot;&lt;tt&gt;memset(P, 0, 40000)&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.  This optimization also allows many loads to be hoisted out of loops, common subexpressions to be eliminated, etc.  This class of undefined behavior can be disabled by passing the -fno-strict-aliasing flag, which disallows this analysis.  When this flag is passed, Clang is required to compile this loop into 10000 4-byte stores (which is several times slower), because it has to assume that it is possible for any of the stores to change the value of P, as in something like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;int main() {
  P = (float*)&amp;amp;P;  // cast causes TBAA violation in zero_array.
  zero_array();
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This sort of type abuse is pretty uncommon, which is why the standard committee decided that the significant performance wins were worth the unexpected result for &quot;reasonable&quot; type casts.  It is worth pointing out that Java gets the benefits of type-based optimizations without these drawbacks because it doesn't have unsafe pointer casting in the language at all.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Anyway, I hope that this gives you an idea of some of the classes of optimizations enabled by undefined behavior in C.  There are many other kinds of course, including sequence point violations like &quot;foo(i, ++i)&quot;, race conditions in multithreaded programs, violating 'restrict', divide by zero, etc.&lt;br&gt;

In our &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know_14.html&quot;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;, we'll discuss why undefined behavior in C is a pretty scary thing if performance is not your only goal. In our final post in the series, we'll talk about how LLVM and Clang handle it.&lt;br&gt;
